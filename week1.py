# Exercise 1: Calculate (100 - 2^5) / 5
# Hint: In Python, exponentiation is done using **
a = 100
b = 2
c = 5
result1 = (a - b**c) / c
print("Result of the first exercise is:", result1)

# Exercise 2: Calculate the area of a circle with radius 7
# Hint: You'll need the value of pi. The easiest way is to import it from the math library.
import math
radius = 7
area = math.pi * (radius**2)
print("The area of the circle is:", area)
