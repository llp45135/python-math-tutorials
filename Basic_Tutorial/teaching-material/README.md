# Tutorials for Machine Learning Courses at Stanford and Cornell

Preparatory material for machine learning courses at Stanford at Cornell. Covers Python and Numpy. This has been used for:
* The probabilistic graphical models and the deep learning courses at Stanford.
* The applied machine learning course and deep generative models courses at Cornell.

## Material

This repo currently holds:

* A [tutorial](https://github.com/kuleshov/cs228-material/blob/master/tutorials/python/cs228-python-tutorial.ipynb) on basic Python/Numpy that is necesseary to get started with the above machine learning classes.

You may follow the iPython notebook on github, or clone and execute it locally.
The notebook is based on an [earlier version](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/) prepared by Justin Johnson.
